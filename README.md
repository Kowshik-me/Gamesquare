## :cricket_game: **Hand Cricket**
Hand Cricket is a game everybody loves to play in their idle time. This game demands no prop but intense hand manipulation and strategies to win. We made this game as traditional as possible there will be a toss to start the game. **For playing, you have to choose a number between 1 to 6, and then a number is selected by the computer. In case both choose a different number, then the batsman's score is equal to the number chosen by him. The total score keeps on adding until both come up with the same number. After that, the batsman will out.** To win, you have to score more than the computer scored if you are the bowler in the first innings and if not, then you have to out the computer before it reaches to target, and that’s it, so now give it a try and score run.

## :boom: **Matchtrix**
Matchtrix is a game where you have **to pick matchsticks minimum 1 to a maximum 4** turn by turn from the pile of 21 matchsticks, and the **one who picks the last one loses the game.** Simple, isn’t it?

## :game_die: **Puzznic**
Puzznic is an interestingly challenging game where **you have to arrange the jumbled up numbers in a sequential manner in a matrix of 4x4 under 500 moves.** For moving in the puzzle, you have to use arrow keys, and at any time during the game, use the 'ESC’ button for back to the menu.
