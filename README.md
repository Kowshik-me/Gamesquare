## :cricket_game: **Hand Cricket**
Hand Cricket is a game everybody loves to play in their idle time. This game demands no prop but intense hand manipulation and strategies to win. We made this game as traditional as possible there will be a toss to start the game. **For playing, you have to choose a number between 1 to 6, and then a number is selected by the computer. In case both choose a different number, then the batsman's score is equal to the number chosen by him. The total score keeps on adding until both come up with the same number. After that, the batsman will out.** To win, you have to score more than the computer scored if you are the bowler in the first innings and if not, then you have to out the computer before it reaches to target, and that’s it, so now give it a try and score run.
